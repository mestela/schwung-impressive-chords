# Impressive Chords for Schwung

This is a MIDI FX module for Schwung that generates impressive chords with strumming, tilt, and articulation controls. It's a port of Expressive Chords, a M4L device for Ableton Live.

## Inspiration and Process
This module was inspired by the "Expressive Chords" concept. The chord presets were extracted from the source data and ported to this native C implementation to provide dynamic chord generation, strumming, tilting, and articulation.

Renamed to "Impressive Chords" to clarify that it is unaffiliated with the official Ableton project.

## Installation

You can install this module directly from this repository on your Move device:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh install-module-github mestela/schwung-impressive-chords
```

## Parameters

- **Preset**: Select from 52 different chord presets (Indie Jazz, Guitar Voicings, etc.).
- **Base Note**: The MIDI note that triggers the chord.
- **Transpose**: Transpose the output notes.
- **Invert**: Shift notes up or down by octave (-12 to +12).
- **Strum**: Delay between notes in milliseconds (0-100ms).
- **Tilt**: Velocity ramp across notes (higher notes louder or softer).
- **Articulate**: Different strum orders (1: Low to High, 2: Outside-In, 3: High to Low, 4: Even/Odd, 5: Inside-Out, 6: Odd/Even, 7: Random).
- **Length**: Control length of notes (10-2000ms).
- **Retrigger**: Clock-synced retriggering (0 Off, 1 1B, 2 1/2B, etc.).
- **Timing**: Straight, Dotted, Triplet.
- **Choke**: Cut previous notes on retrigger or new note (0 or 1).
- **Notes Limit**: Force only this number of notes to play (0-12, 0 = no limit).
